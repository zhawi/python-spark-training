# Spark Examples to practice with PySpark

The goal of this environment and what i'm building here is to practice spark examples and to use python to do so.
Intended to design a full blown python app later on, but for now it is only examples, practice examples to practice.
Application will be build in OOP design, most likely will just make v2.0 of the project already built in my github but changing the scala app for a python app.
