# Spark Examples to practice with PySpark

The goal of this environment and what i'm building here is to practice spark examples and to use python to do so.\
All the examples here are ran locally and the idea is just to pratice pyspark.\
In my case I'm using a macbook so every terminal command will be done in bash command line.


### Important steps:

- Install spark directly on the machine;
- create a virtual environment for python so that you can install pyspark there;
- make the main directory the PYTHONPATH of your virtual environment with the following command:

``` bash
$export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)
```
